              The California Vehicle Code (CVC) encompasses an extensive range
              of regulations governing the operation of vehicles on public roads
              within the state. It covers areas such as licensing and
              registration, traffic rules, vehicle equipment, and maintenance,
              traffic violations and penalties, pedestrian safety, special
              vehicles and situations, driver responsibilities, and driver
              education. The CVC sets forth rules for obtaining driver's
              licenses, adhering to traffic signals and signs, maintaining
              vehicle safety, yielding to pedestrians, and addressing specific
              scenarios like adverse weather conditions. It's a comprehensive
              legal framework crucial for ensuring safe and lawful driving

              maximum speed limit on highways is 65 miles per hour unless a
              different speed limit is posted. However, on two-lane, undivided
              highways, the speed limit is generally set at 55 miles per hour,
              unless otherwise indicated based on an engineering and traffic
              survey. The Legislature aims to ensure appropriate signage for the
              55 miles-per-hour speed limit on affected two-lane, undivided
              highways, including signs at county boundaries and other suitable

              In regards to the basic speed law, as outlined in Section 22352 of
              the California Vehicle Code, the speed of a vehicle within the
              specified limits or as authorized by the code is considered
              lawful, unless proven to be in violation of the basic speed law.
              Exceeding the prima facie speed limits stated in Section 22352 is
              considered prima facie unlawful, unless the defendant can provide
              competent evidence demonstrating that the speed did not violate
              the basic speed law at the specific time, place, and under the
              prevailing conditions. <br />
              The prima facie speed limits are further defined as follows:

              prosecution must provide a factual basis for the satisfaction or

              DUI penalties. <br />
              Probation for a reckless driving conviction that is a prior
              offense for DUI penalties requires the defendant to enroll in an
              alcohol and drug education program, with exceptions under certain
              circumstances. <br />
              If a defendant's reckless driving offense occurs within ten years

              must order participation in a program consisting of at least 60
