              <p className="courseText">
                Motorcycles are a common sight on roads, especially during
                warmer months. However, due to their smaller size and narrower
                profile compared to cars, motorcycles can be harder to see,
                leading to potential risks for both motorcyclists and other
                drivers.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                One of the primary difficulties when sharing the road with
                motorcycles is their reduced visibility. As a driver, you need
                to be mindful of the blind spots around your vehicle.
                Motorcycles can easily fall into these blind spots, making them
                virtually invisible in the mirrors. To mitigate this risk, it is
                essential to adjust your side mirrors correctly to minimize
                blind spots and consistently check them before changing lanes or
                making turns. Incorporating shoulder checks into your driving
                habits can provide an extra layer of safety, as physically
                turning your head allows you to see any vehicles, including
                motorcycles, that might not be visible through mirrors alone.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Apart from blind spots, motorcycles can also be obscured by
                other traffic, especially in congested or heavy traffic
                conditions. As a driver, it is your responsibility to remain
                alert and practice defensive driving. By maintaining a safe
                following distance from the vehicle in front, we can have a
                clear view of the road ahead, including motorcycles. This
                additional space also allows motorcyclists to maneuver safely
                without feeling crowded by other vehicles.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Intersections are critical areas where extra caution is
                necessary. Motorcycles may approach intersections more quickly
                than cars, making their movements less predictable. Before
                making a left turn or turning on red lights, it's crucial to
                double-check for approaching motorcycles and ensure they have
                enough time to clear the intersection safely. Being patient and
                allowing motorcycles to proceed first when appropriate can
                prevent potential collisions.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Providing enough space for motorcycles is crucial to their
                safety. Motorcycles can stop more quickly than cars due to their
                lighter weight. Therefore, leaving a generous following distance
                is essential. Tailgating motorcycles is not only risky but also
                intimidating for motorcyclists. Keeping a safe following
                distance gives both drivers and motorcyclists ample reaction
                time and helps create a safer road environment for everyone.

              <h5 className="sectionSubheading">
                B. Motorcycles are harder to steer in emergencies and are
                committed to their previously chosen path.
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Unlike cars, which have four wheels providing stability,
                motorcycles have only two wheels, making them inherently less
                stable and more challenging to control in certain circumstances.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                One critical characteristic of motorcycles is their commitment
                to their chosen path. Cars change direction by turning the
                steering wheel, motorcycles steer by leaning. Once a motorcycle
                is leaned into a turn, it becomes challenging to change its path
                abruptly without causing a loss of control. This is known as
                "countersteering," where the rider applies slight pressure in
                the opposite direction they want to turn, causing the motorcycle
                to lean in the desired direction. Once the lean is initiated,
                the motorcycle is committed to the curve it's taking, and sudden
                changes can lead to accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                In emergencies, such as encountering unexpected obstacles or
                hazards on the road, motorcycles require more skill and finesse
                to navigate safely. For instance, if a car suddenly swerves into
                the path of an approaching motorcycle, the motorcyclist may not
                have enough time or space to avoid a collision. In such cases,
                other drivers need to be attentive and avoid making sudden
                maneuvers that could jeopardize the safety of motorcyclists.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Moreover, braking on a motorcycle is different from braking in a
                car. Motorcycles have separate front and rear brakes, and during
                emergency braking, a significant portion of the stopping power
                comes from the front brake. However, applying too much front
                brake suddenly can cause the motorcycle's front wheel to lock
                up, leading to a dangerous situation known as a "front-wheel
                skid."
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                To address these challenges, motorcyclists undergo training to
                enhance their riding skills, including emergency maneuvers and
                proper braking techniques. It is essential to be aware of
                motorcycles' limitations and give them enough space on the road.
                Avoid tailgating motorcycles and provide extra following
                distance to account for their potentially slower stopping
                ability.

                When cycling, cyclists must make major adjustments in speed to
                safely navigate hazards like storm drains, gravel surfaces, or
                potholes. For instance, hitting a pothole at high speed could
                lead to loss of control and accidents. When approaching a storm
                drain or gravel surface, slowing down is crucial to maintain
                stability and avoid skidding. Additionally, cyclists needs to
                maintain a straight path when riding over these hazards to
                reduce the risk of accidents.

                Wet roads significantly reduce the traction between the tires
                and the road surface, increasing the likelihood of skidding and
                losing control. When cycling on a rain-slick road or through
                puddles, cyclists must reduce their speed to minimize the risk
                of hydroplaning. Hydroplaning occurs when a thin layer of water
                accumulates between the tires and the road surface, causing the
                tires to lose contact with the road. Lowering speed helps
                improve traction and gives cyclists more control over their
                bikes.

                <span className="bold">c. Rain and/or wind is strong: </span>
                Cycling in strong rain and wind can be particularly challenging
                and dangerous. Strong wind gusts can push cyclists off course,
                while heavy rain reduces visibility and makes the road surface
                slippery. In such conditions, cyclists must make significant
                adjustments to their speed and consider taking shelter if the
                weather becomes too severe. Slowing down and maintaining a firm
                grip on the handlebars is crucial to staying in control of the
                bicycle during gusty conditions.

                D. Be on the Watch for Careless Motorcyclists
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Motorcyclists are vulnerable road users, lacking the protective
                structure of enclosed vehicles. Be cautious and attentive around
                motorcyclists to avoid collisions and potential injuries. Their
                exposure during accidents can lead to severe harm, making it
                crucial for you to take extra care when sharing the road with
                them.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Collisions involving motorcycles often result in more severe
                injuries or fatalities compared to accidents involving only
                cars. Without the protection of airbags or seat belts,
                motorcyclists are at greater risk of direct impact during a
                crash. Even at lower speeds, accidents with motorcycles can have
                life-altering consequences.

                E. Beware of Motorcyclists Splitting Lanes
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Lane splitting is a practice where motorcyclists ride between
                lanes of slow-moving or stopped traffic, often seen in congested
                conditions. While its legality varies by region, drivers must
                remain aware of this maneuver to ensure road safety and prevent
                potential accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                The unexpected presence of lane-splitting motorcyclists can
                catch drivers off guard, particularly if they are not accustomed
                to this practice. Motorcycles can swiftly emerge between cars,
                requiring drivers to be vigilant and cautious to avoid
                collisions. Both drivers and motorcyclists face reduced reaction
                time during lane splitting, emphasizing the need for
                attentiveness and quick responses to sudden movements or lane
                changes.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Motorcycles' narrower profile allows them to fit between lanes,
                but the limited clearance leaves little room for error. Any
                abrupt movements by either drivers or motorcyclists can lead to
                dangerous situations. Additionally, lane-splitting motorcyclists
                might be partially obscured by other vehicles, making them
                harder to spot in busy traffic. Therefore, you must exercise
                careful observation and remain attentive to your surroundings.
