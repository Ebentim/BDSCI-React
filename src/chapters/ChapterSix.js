              Fatigue diminishes alertness and vigilance, increasing the
              likelihood of errors, near-misses, and accidents. It impairs
              reaction time, making it more challenging to respond promptly to
              unexpected situations on the road. Fatigue affects attention and
              concentration, leading to decreased situational awareness and an
              increased risk of missing important cues or hazards. It can impair
              decision-making skills, leading to poor judgment and risky
              behaviors while driving.

            </p>
            <p className="courseText">
              When a driver is well-rested, several important aspects of their
              driving abilities are positively influenced. One key benefit is
              the heightened sense of awareness that comes with being adequately
              rested. A rested driver is more attuned to their surroundings, and
              able to perceive potential hazards and changes in road conditions
              more effectively. Additionally, their reaction time becomes
              notably improved. This means they can promptly respond to
              unexpected situations, such as sudden stops or swerving vehicles,
              decreasing the likelihood of accidents. Moreover, well-rested
              drivers tend to make better decisions while driving. Adequate rest
              supports cognitive functions, allowing for more sound judgments,
              even in challenging or high-pressure driving scenarios.

              can enhance road safety by eliminating distractions through
              practical measures. Cell phone usage should be limited to safe
              locations, like parking spots. Eating, drinking, and grooming are
              best done outside of driving, while music choices should
              prioritize focus. Conversations with passengers should be light
              and during stops. Preparing in-vehicle tech before driving reduces
              distractions. Daydreaming should be avoided; staying present and
              engaged is vital. External distractions, like roadside incidents,
              mustn't overshadow road attention.

              Not yielding the right of way can cause big problems. It can lead

              very close to doing so. This can hurt drivers, passengers, and
              pedestrians, and sometimes even cause deaths. There are also legal
              issues. In California, not yielding the right of way is against
              the rules. People who do this might have to pay money, get points
              on their driving record, or face other punishments. Plus, it makes
              traffic worse. When drivers don't let others go first, it messes
              up the flow of traffic, making things slow down and causing
              trouble for everyone else on the road.

              Failure to keep to the right, commonly known as "hogging the road"
              or "lane hogging," refers to a driving behavior where a driver
              remains in the left lane of a multi-lane road, even when it's not
              necessary for passing, and obstructs the flow of traffic. This

              cultivate a practice of staying in the right lane, reserving the
              left lanes primarily for overtaking slower vehicles. This
              arrangement helps keep the flow of traffic steady and predictable.
              Also, when faster-moving vehicles approach from behind, it's
              crucial to yield to them by moving to the right. Allowing faster
              traffic to pass safely helps prevent congestion and potential
              hazards. Remember that the left lanes should be used exclusively
              for passing slower vehicles. Once the overtaking is complete, make
              a point to return to the right lane, promoting a smoother traffic

            <p classname="courseText">
              Driving a vehicle with faulty brakes is highly unsafe and raises
              the risk of accidents. Poor brakes can make it much harder to stop
              quickly, potentially leading to accidents such as rear-end
              collisions. They also make it difficult to maintain control in
              emergencies. Neglecting brake repairs can even cause more damage
              to other brake components, resulting in more extensive and costly
              fixes down the road. It's crucial to address brake issues promptly
              to ensure safe driving and prevent further complications.
