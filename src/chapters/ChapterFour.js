              <p className="courseText">
                Traffic control signals are devices that alternately direct
                traffic to stop and proceed using the colors green, yellow, and
                red. They can be vertical or horizontal, manually, electrically,
                or mechanically operated. They can also be fixed or portable and
                based on fixed time or vehicle actuation. Traffic control
                signals are used to control the flow of vehicular and pedestrian
                traffic, prevent excessive delays, and assign the right-of-way.

                intersection. Intersections create conflict points where traffic
                moves against and across itself, and pedestrian and bicycle
                safety depends on following traffic rules. Some safety measures
                include separating road users in time and space with signals,
                crosswalks, and bicycle crossings. Drivers should keep a safe
                distance, inspect the intersection, and be patient at every

                approximately 500 people lose their lives while trespassing on
                railroad tracks. To avoid such potential dangers, it is crucial
                to stay away from railroad tracks unless using designated

                Consider the stopping distance of trains, which is another
                critical factor. On average, it takes a train over a mile to
                come to a complete stop. This extensive stopping distance
                emphasizes the need for allowing sufficient time and distance to
                safely cross railroad tracks.

                Contrary to common belief, the majority of vehicle-train crashes
                occur when the train is traveling at speeds less than 30 miles
                per hour. This unexpected finding highlights the necessity of
                caution and attentiveness at all railroad crossings, regardless
                of the train's speed.

                The dangers associated with railroad tracks and crossings cannot
                be overstated. With an alarming number of deaths occurring each
                year, it is vital to respect the potential risks, adhere to
                designated crossings, and exercise caution when approaching and
                traversing railroad tracks.

                  stop at a safe distance away from the school bus and remain
                  stopped until the red lights stop flashing. This is to ensure
                  the safety of children who are getting on or off the bus.

                <li className="courseText">
                  School buses are now required to activate red lights at all

                <li className="courseText">
                  Always obey hand signals and other instructions of school bus

                </li>
                <li className="courseText">
                  Be as courteous as possible to school buses and give them the
                  right of way whenever possible. School buses often make
                  frequent stops, so being patient and allowing them to proceed
                  can help ensure the safety of everyone.
                </li>

                  Do not pull out in front of school buses or otherwise cause

                  Be very cautious around stopped school buses, even if the red
                  lights are not flashing. Assume that a child might dart out in
                  front of you. Children can be unpredictable, and it's crucial
                  to exercise caution when driving near a stopped school bus, as
                  children may be crossing the road.

                <li className="courseText">
                  Treat school bus stops as school zones; drive 25 M.P.H. or

                  children gather, and it's essential to drive slowly and
