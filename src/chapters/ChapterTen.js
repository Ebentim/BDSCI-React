              <p className="courseText">
                Alcohol is classified as a depressant drug that affects the
                entire nervous system. A typical alcoholic drink contains about
                three-fifths of an ounce of alcohol. The amount of alcohol in
                different types of drinks may vary, but generally, one beer, one
                glass of wine, and one shot of distilled spirits contain about
                the same amount of alcohol.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                When alcohol is ingested, around 5% is directly absorbed by the
                mouth and throat, while the remaining 95% is absorbed through
                the digestive system. Unlike some substances, alcohol cannot be
                stored in the body's tissues for later use.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                The body eliminates alcohol through various processes, with less
                than 10% being eliminated through excretion and evaporation via
                the kidneys, lungs, and skin. Around two to five percent of
                alcohol is excreted unchanged through sweat and urine. The
                majority, approximately 90%, is metabolized by the liver through
                oxidation. The liver breaks down alcohol into simpler compounds
                and eliminates it from the body. On average, the liver
                metabolizes about one standard drink per hour.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Excessive alcohol consumption can have harmful effects on the
                body, impairing cognitive functions, coordination, and judgment,
                which can lead to dangerous situations, including impaired
                driving. Responsible alcohol consumption, along with awareness
                of legal limits and safety guidelines, is crucial to ensuring
                personal safety and the safety of others.

              <p className="courseText">
                <span className="bold">Judgment: </span>Depth perception is the
                ability to accurately judge the distance and relative positions
                of objects in one's surroundings. However, alcohol affects the
                brain's visual processing centers, leading to distorted
                perceptions of distance and space. This impairment can have
                serious consequences for drivers, as they may misjudge the
                distance between their vehicle and other objects on the road,
                such as cars, pedestrians, or obstacles.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                For example, impaired depth perception may cause a driver to
                underestimate the distance between their vehicle and the one in
                front of them, leading to following too closely and increasing
                the risk of a rear-end collision. Additionally, gauging the
                timing and distance required for maneuvers like merging into
                traffic or making turns becomes challenging, potentially leading
                to erratic driving behavior and higher chances of accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Moreover, alcohol reduces inhibitions and impairs judgment,
                leading to increased risk-taking behavior while driving.
                Intoxicated drivers are more likely to engage in reckless
                behaviors, such as attempting unsafe passes, ignoring traffic
                signals, or exceeding speed limits. Their impaired judgment may
                lead to poor decision-making in hazardous situations, further
                elevating the risk of accidents and injuries.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                The combination of impaired depth perception and increased
                risk-taking tendencies creates a dangerous scenario on the road.
                Intoxicated drivers may attempt risky maneuvers without
                accurately assessing the potential consequences, posing
                significant dangers to themselves and others. It is crucial to
                emphasize the importance of never driving under the influence of
                alcohol to ensure road safety for all.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                <span className="bold">Awareness: </span>Alcohol impairs a
                driver's ability to scan their environment effectively. Instead
                of keeping their focus on the road ahead and being aware of
                their surroundings, impaired drivers may fixate on a single
                point, leading to reduced awareness of potential hazards or
                obstacles in their peripheral vision. This limited scanning
                ability can increase the risk of colliding with objects or other
                vehicles that the driver fails to notice.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Impaired drivers have difficulty performing multiple tasks
                simultaneously. Driving safely requires the ability to process
                various stimuli at once, such as monitoring traffic signals,
                checking mirrors, and anticipating potential hazards. Alcohol
                hampers the brain's multitasking capabilities, making it
                challenging for the driver to respond quickly to changing road
                conditions and hazards.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Alcohol can cause forgetfulness and lapses in attention, leading
                to drivers neglecting essential safety measures. Impaired
                drivers may forget to turn on their headlights or may fail to
                dim their bright lights for oncoming traffic at night. These
                lapses in attentiveness can reduce their visibility and
                compromise the safety of other road users.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                One of the most apparent signs of an impaired driver is their
                erratic and unpredictable driving behavior. Intoxicated drivers
                may travel at inconsistent speeds, make sudden and unanticipated
                lane changes, miss stop signs or traffic signals, and commit
                other serious driving errors. These blunders can create
                dangerous situations for themselves and others on the road.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Overall, alcohol's impact on awareness can lead to dangerous
                driving behaviors, reduced ability to multitask, and an
                increased likelihood of traffic violations. Impaired drivers
                often exhibit erratic driving patterns, making it challenging
                for other road users to anticipate their actions and respond
                appropriately. To avoid accidents and promote road safety, it is
                essential to refrain from driving under the influence of alcohol
                and to encourage responsible alternatives when alcohol is
                involved.

              <p className="courseText">
                <span className="bold">Vision: </span>Alcohol slows down the
                eyes' ability to adjust to varying light levels. As a result,
                when transitioning from well-lit areas to darker sections of the
                road, or vice versa, an impaired driver's eyes may take longer
                to adapt. This slow adjustment can lead to temporary blindness
                or reduced visibility, making it challenging to identify
                hazards, pedestrians, or obstacles in the roadway.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Alcohol affects the eye muscles responsible for lateral eye
                movement, leading to a phenomenon known as tunnel vision. In
                this state, the driver's field of view becomes restricted, and
                they may primarily focus on what is directly in front of them,
                neglecting peripheral vision. Tunnel vision reduces the driver's
                ability to detect hazards from the sides, increasing the risk of
                colliding with objects or other vehicles coming from the
                periphery.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                These visual impairments can have severe consequences on the
                driver's ability to safely operate a vehicle. With slow light
                adjustment, the driver may fail to notice pedestrians, cyclists,
                or obstacles in poorly lit areas or during transitions between
                different light conditions. Tunnel vision limits the driver's
                situational awareness, reducing their ability to anticipate and
                react to sudden changes or hazards on the road. It is crucial to
                avoid driving under the influence of alcohol to ensure clear and
                unimpaired vision, allowing for safe navigation of the roadways
                and the protection of oneself and others.

              <p className="courseText">
                <span className="bold">Reaction Time: </span>Alcohol affects the
                central nervous system, which plays a crucial role in processing
                information and transmitting signals for quick responses. When
                under the influence, a driver's reaction time is significantly
                slowed, making it challenging to respond to known threats, such
                as a car suddenly stopping in front of an unexpected pedestrian
                crossing the road. This delay can lead to collisions or the
                inability to avoid accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Impaired drivers face difficulties in quickly processing and
                analyzing information from their surroundings. This affects
                their ability to make timely decisions when faced with rapidly
                changing traffic conditions, such as avoiding a collision with
                another vehicle or navigating through complex intersections. The
                delay in decision-making can have serious consequences and
                increase the likelihood of accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Alcohol's effect on the nervous system can also impact basic
                reflexes, such as quickly removing a foot from the accelerator
                to brake or steering away from an obstacle. These slowed
                reflexes make it challenging for the driver to respond promptly
                to unexpected situations, leading to a higher risk of accidents.
                It is essential to avoid driving under the influence of alcohol
                to ensure quick and effective reactions to potential dangers on
                the road, ensuring the safety of oneself and others.

                Alcohol is Involved in About 40% of all Fatal Highway Accidents.
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
                (NHTSA), about 30% of all traffic crash fatalities in the United
                States involve drunk drivers (with BACs of .08 g/dL or higher).
                In 2020, there were 11,654 people killed in these preventable
                crashes. On average over the 10 years from 2011-2020, about
                10,500 people died every year in drunk-driving crashes. Every
                day, 30 people in the United States die in car crashes with an
                alcohol-impaired driver. This is one death every 50 minutes.
              </p>
              <p className="sectionQuote">
                A young driver with an ABC of only .02 to .05 percent is at
                least seven times more likely to be killed in an accident than a
                sober driver.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                When a young driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) falls
                within the range of 0.02 to 0.05 percent, their risk of being
                killed in a collision increases significantly compared to a
                sober driver. This heightened risk is influenced by several
                factors.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Alcohol impairs cognitive abilities, such as judgment,
                attention, and decision-making. Even at lower BAC levels, a
                young driver's ability to process information and make
                appropriate choices is compromised, leading to poor driving
                decisions
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Additionally, alcohol reduces vision and coordination. Young
                drivers may struggle to accurately assess distances and perceive
                potential hazards on the road due to impaired visual acuity and
                depth perception. Their coordination may also be affected,
                impacting their ability to control the vehicle effectively.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Moreover, alcohol slows down a young driver's reaction time.
                Responding promptly to sudden changes in traffic or road
                conditions becomes challenging, increasing the risk of
                accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Furthermore, young drivers may become overconfident under the
                influence of alcohol. This overconfidence can lead them to take
                unnecessary risks and engage in reckless behaviors, further
                raising the likelihood of accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Furthermore, young drivers are already at a higher risk of
                accidents due to their limited driving experience. When alcohol
                is involved, their driving skills are further compromised,
                amplifying the risk of collisions.

              <h5 className="sectionSubheading">D. Alcohol and the Law</h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                In California, a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08% is
                considered the legal threshold for driving under the influence
                (DUI). If a driver's BAC is measured at or above .08%, they can
                be arrested and charged with DUI, leading to legal penalties and
                the potential loss of driving privileges. Additionally, drivers
                under the legal drinking age, typically under 21, are subject to
                a much lower BAC limit of .01%, with severe penalties, including
                license suspension, for any detectable alcohol in their system.
                California follows implied consent laws, requiring drivers to
                submit to chemical tests if lawfully arrested on suspicion of
                DUI, and admin per se laws, resulting in automatic license
                suspension for driving with a BAC at or above the legal limit.
                The state treats DUI offenses seriously, implementing stringent
                penalties to deter impaired driving and prioritize road safety.
