              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                With nearly 1,000 bicyclist deaths and over 130,000 injuries
                occurring yearly due to road crashes in the US, these figures
                serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with cycling.
                While adults constitute the majority of casualties, the
                vulnerability of children, adolescents, teens, and young adults
                cannot be ignored. These age groups face the highest rates of
                bicycle-related injuries, as evidenced by the significant number
                of emergency department visits. The RoSPA report's revelation of
                16,884 cyclists injured in road accidents in a single year
                further accentuates the need for caution. Particularly
                concerning is the statistic that children aged 9-12 have a
                higher percentage of bicycle fatalities compared to younger
                children, while pedestrian fatalities account for a considerable
                portion of crash deaths among young children. This collective
                data is a resounding call for individuals to exercise vigilance
                and follow road safety rules to safeguard themselves and others
                on the roads.

                Being a responsible pedestrian means being aware of your
                surroundings and taking necessary precautions when crossing
                intersections. By following traffic signals and watching for
                vehicles that may not stop, you can help ensure a safer crossing
                experience. Do not forcefully claim the right of way, pay
                attention to turning vehicles, and avoid distractions. When
                possible, walk with a group to increase safety. Always be
                prepared to stop at any moment and always exercise caution. By
                taking these steps, you can positively impact your safety and

              <p className="courseText">
                Intersections controlled by stop signs require pedestrians to be
                cautious and proactive in ensuring their safety. Before
                crossing, make eye contact with drivers at the stop signs to
                ensure they see you and acknowledge your intention to cross.
                This visual confirmation helps prevent accidents caused by
                miscommunication between pedestrians and drivers.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Don't assume others will stop just because one car has. Wait

              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Crossing at intersections and refraining from jaywalking are
                vital practices. Adhering to designated crosswalks or
                intersections enhances your visibility to drivers and reduces
                the risk of accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Jaywalking is often prohibited and subject to fines. Using
                crosswalks and intersections grants pedestrians the right of

              <p className="courseText">
                Have you ever wondered why it is safer to walk facing the cars
                on the road? There are many reasons for this. First, you can see
                the cars better and they can see you better. This way, you can
                make eye contact with the drivers and know what they are going
                to do. You can also notice if a car is coming too close to you
                or if a driver does not see you. This way, you can move away or
                warn them in time. You can also judge when it is safe to cross
                the road by looking at the traffic. This way, you can avoid
                getting hit by a car that is turning or changing lanes.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                You should always use the sidewalk if there is one and stay as
                far to the left as possible if there is not. You should also
                avoid using your phone or listening to music while walking, as
                these can distract you and make you less aware of your
                surroundings.

                F. Wear Bright and/or Reflective Clothing
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Wearing bright and reflective clothing is a paramount aspect of
                pedestrian safety, especially in low-light conditions and near
                roadways. The choice of clothing that enhances visibility
                significantly increases the chances of pedestrians being noticed
                by drivers, ultimately reducing the risk of accidents. Brightly
                colored garments, like fluorescent yellow, green, orange, or
                pink, help you stand out during the day, while reflective
                materials ensure you remain visible in the dark by reflecting
                light to their source, such as headlights.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                In situations with limited visibility, such as dawn, dusk, or
                nighttime, wearing bright or reflective clothing becomes even
                more crucial. This allows drivers to spot you from a greater
                distance and react accordingly.
              </p>
              <h5 className="sectionSubheading">G. Don’t Wear Headphones</h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Avoiding the use of headphones while walking as a pedestrian is
                a critical safety measure that can significantly reduce the risk
                of accidents and improve situational awareness. When you wear
                headphones, you are more likely to become distracted, which can
                lead to serious consequences on the road. Here's why it's
                important not to wear headphones while walking.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Wearing headphones impairs your ability to hear sounds from your
                surroundings, including oncoming traffic, car horns, emergency
                vehicle sirens, bicycle bells, and warning signals. Auditory
                cues play a crucial role in detecting potential hazards and
                avoiding accidents. Using headphones diverts your attention away
                from your environment, making you less aware of potential
                dangers. This distracted walking can lead to unintended
                crossings, failure to notice traffic signals, or stepping into
                the path of oncoming vehicles. Without the ability to hear
                nearby vehicles or environmental cues, you may be caught off
                guard by sudden movements or changes in traffic patterns, making
                it difficult for you to react appropriately. When wearing
                headphones, you might be less likely to hear or respond to
                verbal warnings or instructions from others, such as fellow
                pedestrians, drivers, or emergency responders. For individuals
                with hearing impairments, the use of headphones can further
                hinder their ability to communicate with others and be aware of
                their surroundings, potentially leading to unsafe situations.

              <p className="courseText">
                Walking on railroad tracks is both highly perilous and illegal,
                posing substantial threats to personal safety and resulting in
                severe accidents and injuries. The swift and quiet approach of
                trains creates a challenge for pedestrians to anticipate,
                increasing the risk of potentially fatal collisions.
                Furthermore, the confined space surrounding railroad tracks
                limits escape options, heightening the possibility of being
                unable to evade danger swiftly. Operating on fixed schedules,
                trains can appear unexpectedly, leaving those on the tracks with
                inadequate time to react.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Apart from the imminent physical risks, trespassing on railroad
                tracks is against the law, subjecting individuals to legal
                ramifications like fines and penalties. The uneven and slippery
                terrain, especially during adverse weather, contributes to the
                danger of slips and falls. In addition, the tracks carry high
                voltages for signaling, exposing pedestrians to the grave threat
                of electric shocks or even electrocution. This behavior can
                obstruct train operators' views, leading to delayed responses
                and a heightened risk of accidents.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Pedestrians on tracks also risk being caught in potential train
                derailments, amplifying the hazards of this reckless conduct.
                Given that railroads hold the right of way, pedestrians lack
                legal entitlement to be on tracks, underscoring the significance
                of respecting safety measures and established laws. To
                prioritize personal safety and legal compliance, pedestrians
                must refrain from walking on railroad tracks, opting instead for
                designated crossings or bridges.

                D. Use special care when backing.
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Using special care when backing is crucial for ensuring the
                safety of pedestrians and other vehicles. Limited visibility
                while backing can lead to accidents, making it essential to be
                cautious and attentive during this maneuver. Pedestrian safety
                is of particular concern, as they may not always be visible when
                a vehicle is backing up, especially in blind spots. Avoiding
                collisions with other vehicles or stationary objects is another
                significant reason to exercise special care when backing.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                To back up safely, you should check your surroundings
                thoroughly, using mirrors and looking over your shoulder to have
                a clear view of the area behind the vehicle. If possible, having
                a spotter to guide the backing process can be immensely helpful.
                Modern vehicles equipped with backup cameras and sensors can
                also be valuable aids in enhancing safety. Backing up slowly and
                steadily gives you enough time to react to any unexpected
                obstacles or pedestrians. Properly signaling intentions and
                using the horn when necessary help alert pedestrians and other
                drivers of the vehicle's movement.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Avoiding distractions and staying focused on the backing process
                is crucial. Continuously monitor the mirrors to track the
                movement of pedestrians or other vehicles while backing.
                Additionally, be mindful of tire position, especially during
                parallel parking, to prevent damage to tires or wheels.

                Driving in bike lanes is generally prohibited and can be
                dangerous for both cyclists and motorists. Bike lanes are
                specifically designed to provide a safe and convenient space for
                cyclists, away from faster-moving vehicles. Driving in bike
                lanes can put cyclists at risk of accidents and injuries, and it
                may surprise cyclists and pedestrians, leading to unexpected
                maneuvers and potential collisions. Moreover, driving in bike
                lanes is often a legal violation that can result in fines or
                penalties.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Driving in bike lanes can also disrupt the flow of bicycle
                traffic, causing congestion and frustration among cyclists.
                Additionally, it can cause damage to the lane markings,
                affecting the overall maintenance and safety of the cycling
                infrastructure. However, there are exceptions when driving in
                bike lanes may be permitted, such as making turns at
                intersections or driveways. Nevertheless, this should be done
                with extreme caution and only when no cyclists or pedestrians
                are present.

                When sharing the road with cyclists, it is essential to give
                them adequate space when passing, check blind spots carefully
                before turning or changing lanes, and use turn signals to
                indicate your intentions. Be patient with cyclists who may ride
                at a slower pace and look before opening your car door when
                parked on the side of the road. Exercise caution at
                intersections, and yield to cyclists and pedestrians when making
                turns. Remember that cyclists have the same rights and
                responsibilities as other vehicles on the road, and it is
                essential to share the road responsibly.

                A. Vehicle Damage, and Human Injury From Larger Animals
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Collisions involving animals like deer, moose, elk, and others
                pose significant risks of vehicle damage and human injury. The
                impact of such collisions can cause severe damage to the
                vehicle's body, including the front hood, fenders, and
                windshield, leading to costly repairs. Vital mechanical
                components like the radiator, engine, suspension, and exhaust
                system may also suffer damage, rendering the vehicle inoperable
                and requiring expensive repairs or towing. Airbag deployment in
                severe collisions adds to the expenses, as it necessitates
                replacing the airbags and repairing the steering wheel and
                dashboard. Additionally, tire damage can occur, leading to
                blowouts or punctures that require replacement.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                On the human front, occupants in a collision may experience
                whiplash, musculoskeletal injuries, head and facial injuries,
                fractures, broken bones, and internal organ damage due to the
                forces involved. Unrestrained passengers may be thrown forward
                into the dashboard, windshield, or airbag, leading to severe
                head and facial injuries. In high-speed collisions with large
                animals, occupants may be ejected from the vehicle, further
                increasing the risk of severe injuries or fatalities. Beyond
                physical injuries, being involved in such collisions can have
                long-lasting psychological effects, causing anxiety and
                post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the traumatic
                nature of the experience.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                To mitigate these risks, drivers should exercise caution,
                especially in areas known for animal crossings. Reduce speed,
                especially at dawn and dusk when animals are most active. Use
                high beams when appropriate to spot animals on the road from a
                greater distance. Always wear seat belts and ensure all
                occupants are restrained to reduce the risk of injury in the
                event of a collision.

                B. Animals most active at dusk and dawn
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                Dawn and dusk, often referred to as the "twilight hours,"
                present higher risks for drivers due to reduced visibility and
                increased animal movement. Two types of animals that are notably
                more active during these times are deer and some small mammals.
                Deer, being crepuscular animals, are highly active during dusk
                and dawn as they move between their bedding areas and feeding
                grounds. During these periods, you should exercise caution and
                follow safety precautions to avoid collisions with deer. These
                precautions include reducing speed, staying alert for any
                movement along the roadside, and using high beams when
                appropriate.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Similarly, various small mammals like raccoons are also more
                active during the twilight hours as they seek food and shelter.
                You should scan roadside areas, especially near wooded areas and
                shrubbery, where small mammals may be foraging or crossing. If a
                small animal suddenly crosses the road, it is important to avoid
                swerving to avoid it, as swerving can lead to loss of control or
                collisions with other vehicles. Instead, brake as safely and
                steadily as possible.

              <h5 className="sectionSubheading">
                C. Don’t jeopardize vehicle control when avoiding animals.
              </h5>
              <p className="courseText">
                When drivers encounter animals suddenly on or near the road, it
                is natural to react instinctively. However, making abrupt and
                extreme maneuvers to avoid the animal can be dangerous and
                potentially lead to more severe consequences. It is essential
                for you to stay calm and composed in such situations to make
                safe decisions.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Abrupt swerving is hazardous, especially at high speeds, as it
                can cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle, veer into
                oncoming traffic, or collide with other objects. Instead of
                harsh swerving, the best initial response is to slow down
                gradually and apply the brakes smoothly. This gives the animal
                more time to react and move away from the road and allows other
                drivers behind you to anticipate your actions.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Using your horn, if safe to do so, can help alert the animal and
                encourage it to move away from the road. Animals may freeze in
                response to headlights, but the sound of the horn may startle
                them into moving out of the way. While trying to avoid the
                animal, it's essential to stay in your lane and avoid crossing
                into oncoming traffic or driving onto the shoulder excessively.
              </p>
              <p className="courseText">
                Maintaining focus on the road and surroundings is crucial during
                this situation. Animals can behave unpredictably, so being
                prepared for the unexpected is essential. If a collision with
                the animal becomes unavoidable, try to keep the vehicle as
                straight as possible and brake firmly to reduce the impact.
